## üìå Problem Statement

Traditional paper vouchers and coupons often create friction:

- They get lost, forgotten, or expire before being used.
- Businesses struggle with fraud, duplication, and manual tracking.
- The paper-based system creates unnecessary waste and inefficiency.

Imagine you receive a paper coffee voucher after your morning purchase. The next time you visit, you‚Äôve misplaced it ‚Äî or worse, it expired without you noticing. The caf√© loses a customer perk, and you lose the benefit. Multiply this problem across industries, and the system becomes unreliable and wasteful.
